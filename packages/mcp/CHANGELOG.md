# @handamade/psi-mcp

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- cd77458: D43/D44 — agent access. New package `@handamade/psi-mcp`: an MCP server (stdio via
  `npx @handamade/psi-mcp`, hosted Streamable HTTP at https://psi.kurkin.de/mcp) with two
  read-only tools — `search` (briefs over components/tokens/guidance) and `get` (full props,
  token formulas with resolved values in all four themes, topics) — answering from an index
  baked at publish from the generated artifacts. `npx @handamade/psi-mcp init [--claude]`
  generates a marker-delimited agent guide (AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md) from the same index.
  tokens/react bump in lockstep; no API changes in either.
